In HTML, the terms "tags" and "elements" are related but have distinct meanings:

HTML Tags: Tags serve as the fundamental building blocks of HTML markup. They define the structure and presentation of elements within an HTML document. HTML tags are denoted by angle brackets (< and >) and are typically written in pairs, consisting of an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, <img> is an opening tag, and </img> is a closing tag. Tags can also include attributes that provide additional information about the element, such as <img src="image.jpg">, where src is an attribute specifying the image source.

HTML Elements: Elements encompass tags, their content, and any attributes that define them. An HTML element represents a specific component or part of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, or form inputs. An element begins with an opening tag, followed by its content, and ends with a closing tag, encapsulating the content within. For instance, <p>Text content</p> is an HTML element that represents a paragraph containing the content "Text content".

To sum up, HTML tags serve as the syntax used to define elements in the markup language. HTML elements, on the other hand, refer to the combination of tags, content, and attributes that represent distinct components or parts of a web page. Elements are created by enclosing content within opening and closing tags, forming a structured representation of the content on the page.
