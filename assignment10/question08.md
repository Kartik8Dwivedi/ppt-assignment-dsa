The <figure> tag and <img> tag serve different purposes in HTML:

The <img> tag is utilized to insert an image into an HTML document. It is a self-closing tag without any content. It necessitates the src attribute to specify the image source (URL or file path) and the alt attribute to offer alternative text for the image. The primary purpose of the <img> tag is to display visual content on a webpage.

On the other hand, the <figure> tag is employed to wrap a self-contained content block that is referenced from the main content. It is commonly used for various elements like images, illustrations, diagrams, videos, code snippets, and more. The <figure> tag can encompass an <img> tag, along with an optional <figcaption> tag to provide a caption or description for the content.

The main benefit of using the <figure> tag is that it establishes an association between the image and its caption or related content. This association adds semantic meaning to the document and enhances accessibility. The <figure> tag is particularly useful when you want to group an image with its caption or reference the image within a specific context in the document.

example:

<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
  <figcaption>Caption or description for the image</figcaption>
</figure>
